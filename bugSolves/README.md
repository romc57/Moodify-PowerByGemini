# Bug Solves Documentation

This directory contains documentation for bugs that have been solved. 
Each solved bug should have its own markdown file (e.g., `bug_name.md`) describing:
1.  **The Issue**: What was the bug?
2.  **Root Cause**: What caused it?
3.  **The Fix**: How was it resolved?
4.  **Verification**: How was it tested?

This serves as a knowledge base to prevent regressions and help future debugging.
